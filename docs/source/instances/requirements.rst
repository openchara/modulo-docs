Requirments of instances
===================================

For each instance there are some requirements so that a. The user doesn't get confused, and b. Each game doesn't find itself only working for a couple systems.

The requirments:
1. Each instance needs to implement the `standard API <https://charagame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html>`_.

2. Each instance is required to document the quirks it has and refuse to run games that either require quirks it doesn't have, or don't support quirks that it has.

3. Each instance is also required to follow the `standard UI/UX design <https://charagame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/instances/design.html>`_
